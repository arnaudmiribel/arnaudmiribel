👋 Hi there!

I'm Arnaud, a freelance data scientist & machine learning engineer. These days, I'm spending a lot of time with 🎈 [Streamlit](streamlit.io), an awesome team and [project](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)! You can also find me with my friends at [byrd valley](https://byrdvalley.com/) or as an instructor for machine & deep learning courses at [ENSAE](https://www.lecepe.fr/).

Before that, I worked as a data scientist in the [education](https://www.extensionschool.ch/), [healthcare](https://www.chu-grenoble.fr/), [legaltech](https://doctrine.fr/), [research](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) and [banking](https://am.pictet/) sectors.
